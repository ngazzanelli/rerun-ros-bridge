# rerun-ros-bridge

**Bridge between ROS and [Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/): visualize robot data and trajectories.**

This project aims to build a configurable and extensible bridge between ROS (Robot Operating System) and Rerun, enabling visualization of robotic data such as trajectories, sensor readings, and other telemetry.

> ⚠️ **Current Status:** Early prototype. Currently supports a specific, hardcoded ROS setup (fixed topic names, message types, etc). Generalization and configurability are planned.

## Goals

- Provide a flexible bridge between ROS and Rerun.
- Support visualization of common robotics data: trajectories, point clouds, images, etc.
- Allow users to configure topic names and message types dynamically.
- Serve as a drop-in visualization tool for ROS developers using Rerun.
